# AAVE-Liquidity-Protocol-Replica
We are trying to duplicate key components of the Aave liquidity protocol, emphasizing lending, borrowing, interest rate control, and handling of collateral. We aim to support the expansion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by imitating Aave's fundamental features and giving customers a dependable platform to access DeFi services.
